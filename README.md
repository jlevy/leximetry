See the [prose metrics](docs/prose_metrics.md) for more motivation.

| Category | Metric | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 | Value 4 | Value 5 |
| ---------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ***Expression*** | **Clarity** | Contains numerous spelling and punctuation errors and sentences with grammatical errors or that are hard to follow. | Contains errors but is clear and understandable language. | Typical business email quality with few errors in spelling, punctuation, or grammar and may contain a few typos, lack capitalization, etc. | Clear, correct language but with flaws in language use, such as trite phrases or gratuitous big words, or uses good language but is particularly lengthy or dense like some fiction. | Perfect grammar and no typos if short, or written with true clarity if long, suitable for publication without changes in high editorial standard publications like the Wall Street Journal or Oxford University Press. |
|  | **Coherence** | Incoherent with no clear topic or argument. | Weak coherence or an incomplete draft. | Adequate and generally possible to follow. | Strong coherence but has clear gaps or areas where structure or narrative could be improved. | Seamless, with each sentence, paragraph, and section necessary and the whole organized to achieve its purpose. |
|  | **Sincerity** | Trolling or clickbait where nothing said is actually meant. | Confusing content or statements where the intent is completely unclear or deliberately ambiguous. | Promotional or marketing content or content with unclear intent. | Sincerely written content but with an intent to persuade. | Genuine attempt at conveying sentiments if personal, presenting information if non-fiction, or expressing artistic intent for fiction. |
| ***Style*** | **Narrativity** | Pure nonfiction organized by topic with clear scope and very little or no personal stories or narrative. | Mostly informative or factual content without narrative, but some elements of narrative like a technical book with a few personal stories. | Mix of narrative and facts, like a travel blog post or recipe blog that is both a practical guide and includes personal anecdote. | Narrative presentation but the purpose is not narrative, such as a best-selling non-fiction book filled with stories and anecdotes. | Personal experience, autobiography, or fictional story where the purpose of the writing is narrative. |
|  | **Subjectivity** | Everything stated is objectively true or false. | Things stated are mostly objective but may include some personal opinions or interpretations. | A mix of events and a person's feelings about them. | Personal narrative where much is subjective but includes facts, such as childhood recollections. | Everything stated is personal or inner experience. |
|  | **Warmth** | Cold or negative toward reader or subject matter. | Some neutral content but includes expressions of negativity or coldness. | Completely neutral or an even mix of positive and negative emotions. | Neutral tone but with occasional warmth or positive emotion from the writer. | Strong positive emotions expressed toward reader or subject matter. |
| ***Groundedness*** | **Factuality** | Pure fiction. | Content where a reasonable person would have doubts, such as fringe theories or casual speculation by non-experts, or comments made without regard for truth like jokes or trolling that might be true or false, or content from sources known to be frequently inaccurate. | A mix of true statements and things where it is unclear if they are true or false, including assertions with no citation that cannot be confirmed or refuted by sources. | Opinion by someone recognized as an expert in the subject or standard scientific article in a peer-reviewed publication, or writing with verifiable citations, including Wikipedia articles that don't have complete verifiable citations. | Proven and consensus facts verified by multiple third-party sources. |
|  | **Rigor** | Sloppy reasoning and imprecise statements. | Some logical gaps or unclear terms. | Generally logical but could be more precise. | Well-structured with mostly clear reasoning. | Scientifically precise and logical; if objective, assertions have multiple citations from credible sources; if subjective, are thoroughly discussed from multiple perspectives. |
|  | **Thoroughness** | Disjointed ideas or a very short text or post where there was no intention of covering more than a thought. Most single posts on Twitter are like this. | A short post that covers a clear set of ideas but makes no effort to be comprehensive. Many threads on Twitter are like this. | Carefully written and not short, but without thorough citations, such as a typical long blog post. | A focused but thorough work, such as a long research paper with full citations. | Comprehensive and fully researched treatment of the topic. Includes significant numbers of citations and terminology defined within the work. |
| ***Impact*** | **Accessibility** | Requires graduate study or researcher-level knowledge to follow. Research papers are typically in this category. | Requires undergraduate or professional-level knowledge in the field and does not link to background materials or define all terminology. | Requires some background to understand. May define terms or link to background materials. | Accessible to educated general audience but requires significant study. Defines all terms and cites sources for further reading. | Accessible to readers without specialized training and does not require significant time and effort to understand. |
|  | **Longevity** | Today's news only interesting today. | Interesting for a few days to weeks. | Interesting for months, like a New Yorker article. | Interesting for years, like a typical book. | Will be equally of interest 50 years from now, like an encyclopedia article or critically acclaimed book. |
|  | **Harmlessness** | Information that is directly a risk to people, such as instructions on creating weapons or guides to suicide. | Information that may directly lead to tangible and significant negative impacts on people, such as incitement to violence, guides to criminal activity, or deliberately deceptive content, such as about vaccines or elections. | Highly inflammatory discussions such as debates about wars or conflicts, or statements that touch on subjects like race or gender that may be considered biased or offensive by some readers. | Content with opinions that might evoke strong emotions but are not inflammatory. | Pure facts without dangerous applications, unlikely to provoke conflict. |
