# Leximetry: Qualitative Metrics for Prose

This is a new experimental approach to summarizing some qualitative metrics of writing.

See [leximetry.md](src/leximetry/docs/leximetry.md) for more on how it works.

## Usage

Install with `uv tool install --upgrade leximetry`. [Using uv](installation.md) is
highly recommended.

## Example

<div align="center">

<img width="462" alt="Example run of leximetry"
src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c3ac7c-ec4f-485c-955f-b607bf744f18" />

</div>
